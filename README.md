    Woman: Man pages that make you say "<i>woah</i>"
  </b>
</p>

<br>

## Why
Reading man pages in your terminal is cluttered and ugly. The first man page was written in **1971**, and they still look the same. With all of the modern UI trends sweeping the web world, we should not have to struggle with outdated instructions for the very software we have built the web upon.

<br>

Now you can open man pages in your browser using **beautiful, modern css** styling.

## Installation
 ```bash
npm install -g woman
```

<br>
## Usage
View your man pages in a modern way. Ports local ```man``` pages directly into your browser with modern UI and font trends.
